# Mapping Earthquakes

I made an API request to a server to host geo map & tectonic information to populate geo maps with GeoJSON data.
I added multiple layers to a geographical map using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.

This map shows tectonic activity in the last 7 days and includes a legend that shows intensity of the tectonic activity as well as 3 options to view the map (street, satellite, and light). 


Using: 
Javascript
Leaflet Library
Matbox ApI
